         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                        <p>But aboue al, the paines and turmoiles of this trovvbleſom night vvere increaſed far more by the denial of S. Peter.

                     <p>THIS aduiſe is not much differing from the a foreſaid, nor of leſſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie then it; and it is, that the ſeruante of God dooe not content him ſelf, vvith vvhat ſoeuer little taſt he findeth in his praier, as ſome vſe to dooe, vvhoe vvhen they ſhedd a feavve teares, or feele a little tendernes of hart, perſvvade them ſelues, that then they haue accompliſhed and performed theire exerciſe. But this is not enough for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of that thing, vvhich heere vve ſeeke for. For like as a little devv or ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of vvater, is not ſufficient to cauſe the earth to bring forth fruite (vvhich doth no more but onlie alay the duſt, and vvet the vppermoſt parte of the grovvnd) but it is needeful to haue ſo much vvater, that it maie enter into the innermoſt part of the earth, &amp; there ſoke, and vvater through the ſame: euen ſo is it requiſite to haue here abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending more in particular to limite this time, I am of opinion, that vvhat ſoeuer is leſſe than one hovvre and a halfe, or tvvo hovvres, is to ſhort a time for praier: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that oftentimes there is ſpent more than halfe an hovver, in tempering our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, that is, as I ſaid before, in quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our imagination: and ſo al the reſt of the time is requiſite for the enioying of the fruite of praier.

                     <p>FIRST, the remedie for him that vvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſpiritual conſolations, is, that for this he leaue not the exerciſe of his accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med praier, although it ſeeme vnto him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauourie, and of ſmal fruite, but rather put him ſelf in the preſence of almightie God as guiltie and culpable, and examining his conſcience, ſerche vvhither peraduenture he loſt this fauour through his ovvne fault: and praie our lord vvith greate conſidence that he pardon him, and ſhevv him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable riches of his patience and mercie, in ſuffering and forgeuing one, that can doe nothing els but offend him.</p>
                     <p>In this faſhion ſhal he dravv profit of his drynes, taking occaſion to humble him ſelf the more, vvhen he ſeeth hovv much he offendeth, and to loue God the more, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering hovv much he forgiueth him. And
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9410:88"/>albeit he find not taſt in theſe exerciſes, let him not forſake them; becauſe it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſite that that thing be alvvaies ſauourous, vvhich muſt be profitable: at the leſt vviſe this vve finde by experience, that as often as a man perſeuereth in praier, vvith ſom litel attention and care, dooing in this the beſt that he is able, at the end he commeth from thence comforted and ioyful, vvhen he ſeeth, that of his part, he did vvhat laie in him. It is not much to continue much in praier, vvhen there is much conſolation. Much it is, that vvhen there is ſmal deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our praier then be much, and much more the humilitie, and patience, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance in dooing vvel.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo requiſite at ſuch times, to behaue our ſelues vvith more ſollicitude and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, then at other times, vvatching vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the gard of our ſelues, and examining vvith good attention our thoughts, vvoords and deedes.

But that vvhich ought heere to be aduertiſed is, that <hi>the end of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life,</hi> to vvhich ar ordeined al Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundments and counſels, and al ſtatutes &amp; voues of Religion, <hi>is,</hi> as th' Apoſtle ſaieth, <hi>Charitie.</hi> VVhich although it be ſo, yet doe vve not, in the beginning of this treatiſe, ſtraite vvaies ſpeake of this end, but of that, vvhich apperteineth to him, vvhoe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:9410:129"/>taketh vppon him to inſtruct a nouice, nevvlie com out of the vvorld, vvith ſuch inclinations and vvicked cuſtoms, as he bringeth from the ſame. For he that hath this office, muſt cheefelie at end to deſtroye and mortifie ſuch euil habites, and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to plant in theire place al thoſe vertues that be contrarie to them.</p>
               <p>For euen as the Carpenter, vvhich preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to furniſh the timber, for building of a palace of ſom great lord, firſt of al cutteth avvaie the barks of ſuch trees, as be brought from the vvoode, &amp; then doth ſavve, ſquare, and poliſh them, vntill they be fit for his purpoſe; ſo likevviſe the good maiſter of nouices, and he that deſireth to becom the temple and dvvelling place of God, muſt vnderſtand, that firſt he muſt caſt out of his ſoule, al the vvicked and peruerſe cuſtoms vvhich he bringeth from the vvorld, and then muſt adorne and beutifie the ſame, vvith the vvoorks of vertues. And this thing vvhich is the end of him that bringeth vp a nouice, is alſo a meanes to obteine the true end of the lavve, vvhich is Charitie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath ben ſaied. For vvhen the paſsions be once mortified, and vertues planted in theire place; Charitie remaineth as the ladie and Queene of a man: for as our ſovvle is a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:9410:130"/>ſpiritual ſubſtance, ſo is ſhe a frind of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things. Neuertheles the affections of this life dravve her dovvnevvards, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her from flying vp to heauen, vvhere ſhe hath her neaſt.</p>
               <p>Heerehence it is, that as a ſtone, vvhich by force of ſom other thing is holden in a higher place, then his nature requireth, as ſoone as the impediments, that held it, be taken avvay, ſtraite vvais falleth dovvne to the center, vvhich is his natural place: in like manner, vvhen the diſordred paſsions of oure ſoule be once mortified and ſubdued, vvhich ſhe hath to the things of this vvorld, ſhe ſudainlie, being holpen vvith the grace of God, lifteth her ſelf vp to heauen, vvhich is the proper place of her abode.</p>
               <p>This is then the reaſon, vvherefore ſo greate account is made heere of the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our paſsions, becauſe theſe be the chaines, vvhich hold our ſoule bound, &amp; hinder her from flying vpvvards. Vertues alſo be neceſſarie together vvith this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, becauſe they be the inſtruments, vvhich Charitie vſeth in alther vvoorks; no othervviſe then our ſovvle vſeth her faculties, and naturall povvers in all her functions.</p>

               <p>The end then of this entrepriſe ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, is to correct, and mortifie al euil inclinations, and diſordred appetites of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to make a man ſpiritual, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, in ſuch ſort that he obteine the end, for vvhich he vvas created, vvhich is God. The end is to giue the firſt being to a nevv man, not of the earth, but of heauen; not of the fleſh, but of the ſpirite; not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the image of the earthlie Adam, but like to that of the heauenlie; not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the affections and conditions of the firſt generation, vvhich vvas by nature, but according to the ſecond generation, vvhich is by grace. Finallie the end is to dooe that,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:9410:131"/>vvhich God commaunded the Prophet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Berem.</hi> 1.10.</note> vvhen he ſaide. <hi>I haue ſet thee this daie ouer nations and kingdoms, that thou maiſt roote out, and destroie, &amp; diſperſe, &amp; build vp, &amp; plant.</hi> VVhich is as much as to ſaie; that thou pluck of from the ſoule all appetitee &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, that men bring from theirs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vvombe, &amp; the corruption of ſinne; &amp; that thou plant in theire places the plants of vertues, vhich be agreable to the nevv re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, &amp; adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſonns of God.</p>
               <p>Heerehence it appeareth that like as he, vvhoe deſireth to make a pleaſant garden in a hill ful of briars, firſt diggeth vp vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hindereth him, and then planteth in the ſame al ſuch fruteful trees as he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: ſo one that purpoſeth to make his ſovvle a garden ſhut vp and incloſed, and a paradiſe of pleaſure for almightie God, muſt firſt roote out all euil herbs, &amp; al the thornes of vices, and vvicked inclinations of nature, and then forthvvith ſet in theire ſteede, al ſvveete plants &amp; flovvers of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces. In like ſort doe they that mind to make a faire picture; for firſt they prepare the matter, vvhereupon it is to be painted, by plaining and poliſhing the ſame, and taking from it al roughnes: vvhich being donne, they dravv in it vvhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:9410:131"/>they pleaſe. Novv the verie like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is to be neceſſarilie vſed in this ſtate, in vvhich nature remained through ſinne (vvhich before vvas needles) to deſtroye and aboliſh the remaines of that firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and to adorne the ſovvle vvith the vertues of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>VVherfore, as amongſt diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie kind of fruites, ſom there be, that ar fit to be eaten, as ſoone as they be gathered of from the trees, and ſom others that firſt muſt be boiled, or put in conſerue manie daies, to aſſvvage and temper their natural ſharpnes and bitternes, vvith vvhich they grevv; ſo muſt vve vnderſtand,
<note place="margin">Note this</note> that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath had tvvoe ſtates or conditions of being, the one before he fel, the other after his ſinne committed: &amp; that in the firſt he vvas ſo ſeaſoned and ripe, that nothing vvas to be found in him vvorthie of blame or amendment; but in the ſecond there is ſo much to be amended, that ſcarſe he hath anie thing, that needeth not to paſſe firſt through the fiar of the holie ghoſt, that ſo it maie loſe al the vvickednes it hath. And this is one of the chiefeſt points and aduiſes of this affaire; vvhence it appeareth, hovv great an error thoſe bringers vp of nouices commit, vvhoe being intangled and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:9410:132"/>in other things of leſſe importance, imploie not al theire forces in this labour of mortification: vvhereof it enſueth, that men remaine almoſt as they vvere borne, that is in onlie natural goodnes or yll, vvhich is no leſſe inconuenience, then to place a piece of timber in a gorgeous palaice, no othervviſe prepared, then euen as it vvas brought cut out of the vvoode; or to ſet vppon the table in a delicious banket greene oliues, in ſuch ſort as they be gathered from the tree.</p>
               <p>Seeing then that the end of this entrepriſe, is to make a man good and vertuous, that thou be not deceaued vvith vvhatſoeuer ſort of goodnes, thou muſt vnderſtand that there be tvvoe kinds of goodnes; th'one is naturall, and is proper to ſuch, as be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie gentell and vvel condicioned; th'other is ſpiritual, proceeding of grace, and of the feare and loue of God, vvhich is propre to thoſe that be iuſt perſons. Betvvixt theſe tvvo kinds of goodnes there is ſo great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that vvith the firſt, vve nether me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite grace nor glorie, but vvith the ſecond vve obteine the one and the other. And for this purpoſe, the chiefeſt care of a good mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt be, to attend that this ſpirite of the feare and loue of God, be poured into the ſovvle of his nouice, procuring the ſame by
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:9410:132"/>all meanes that maie ſerue to this end, ſuch as ar Praier, Meditation, and Vſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments &amp;c. For othervviſe, vvhat ſoeuer he ſhal doe, vvil be a bodie vvithout ſovvle, an Adam of earth vvithout ſpirite of life, vvhich is a thing of ſmal profit for Religion; becauſe by experience vve ſee, that ſuch, as in religion haue nothing els but this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral goodnes, ar no more to be eſteemed then ſeelie ſoules, or folkes of good paſt, that ar led by euerie man vvhither he vvil, and can not ſaie naie to anie bodie, nor hold hand in anie thing that is commended to them. In ſo much, that a man othervviſe yl bent by nature, vvhich ſtriueth alvvaies through the feare of God, againſt his vvicked incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, is much more vvorth, then is an other, verie vvel inclined by nature, yf he vvant this feare. For as the vviſe man ſaieth, <hi>Better is a liuing dogge, then a dead lion:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.4.</note> becauſe vvithout ſpirite of life, not anie one thing, be it neuer ſo greate, can be grateful and acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>Of that, vvhich hitherto hath ben ſaid, it is manifeſt, hovv that this end, of vvhich vve haue ſpoken, comprehendeth tvvo things; th'one is to driue out of the ſoule al kind of vices; the other is to plant in the ſame al kind of vertues, ſeeing the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:9410:133"/>goeth before the other. For like as in natural things, there can be no generation vvithout corruption; ſo vertues can not be engendred and brought forth in our ſoule, yf our vices be not firſt dead: nether can the ſpirit freelie raigne and gouerne, yf the fleſh be not before vanquiſhed and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com.</p>
               <p>Theſe tvvo ends the Apoſtle had then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, vvhen he ſaid, vvriting to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:9410:133"/>is, that a man denie his ovvne vvil, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination, vvith al the affections and appetites thereof, and that he haue no lavv vvith them, nor in anie vviſe acknovvledge them, thereby to folovv and obey them. The ſecond and laſt end he declared, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>let him folovv me,</hi> that is, let him folovv all the paſes and examples of my life, and al the vertues that he ſhall find in me. And in that vvhich he ſaied, <hi>Let him take vp his Croſſe,</hi> to vvit of trauail and auſteritie, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the chiefeſt meane and inſtrument, neceſſarie for the one and the other end: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that neither rooting out of vices and ouercomming of nature, nether planting of vertues, can be donne vvithout trauail and paine, for ſomuch as there is great difficultie, as vvel in the one, as in the other.</p>
               <p>By that vvhich hath ben ſaied, vve maie plainelie gather of vvhat condition this nevv vvarfare is, to vvhich a man is called, and vvhat ſort of profeſſion it is: for he is not called to a delicate and quiet life (as ſom doe imagin) but to the Croſſe, to trauail, to ſight againſt his paſſions, to pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that loueth his life, ſhall loſe it; and he that hateth his life in this vvorld, doth keepe it to life euerlaſting.</hi> It is no matter of ſmal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to vvin and ſubdue nature, and to make of fleſh ſpirite, of earth heauen, and of a man an Angel. For if in deede to make of a greene hearbe, fine and delicate linnen cloth, there needeth ſo much mortifying &amp; trauail about the ſame, by reaſon of the greate difference there is, betvvixt the one and the other; hovv much more is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, for the making of this ſo greate a change, of a man into an Agel? They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that vvhen a ſnake vvil change his ſkinne, he entreth by a verie narovv and ſtraite hole, that by this meanes he maie ſhift of his ould ſkinne: he then that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to ſtrippe him ſelf of the ould man, &amp; to put on the nevv, hovv can he bring this to paſſe, by leading a large &amp; delicate life? There can be no generation vvithout cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, nether can a man atteine to be that, vvhich he is not, yf firſt he leaue not to be that, vvhich he is: a thing that can not be donne vvithout great paine and labour.</p>
               <p>The life of a Chriſtian man is ordeined to a ſupernaturall end, and ſo preſuppoſeth ſupernatural forces, and conſequentlie this
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:9410:134"/>life it ſelf muſt be ſupernatural, to vvhich thing fleſh and bloud can not arriue. VVoe to that Religion, vvhoſe manner of life is vvide and large, for in it a man ſhal goe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies vvith a vveake and faint ſtomacke, and one libertie vvil aſk an other, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacie vvil dravv an other. Religious life ought to be ſuch, that like as the ſea caſteth from it ſelf all dead bodies, and the pot, that boileth, all the froth and ſcume, that is vvithin it; ſo ſhee ſhould berid her ſelf of all the ſcume that ſhe hath, &amp; of al the dead carcaſes vvhich ſhe findeth to be in her.

                  <p>This then beeing ſoe, it is neceſſarie to prouide ſom kind of plaiſter and medicine; to amend this vvickednes of our hart, and to put it in ſuch diſpoſition, that it maie loue vvhat is good, and abhorre the contrarie; ſeeing that vvithout this it is impoſſible, either toe ſhake of vices, or to obteine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Therfore this is that vvhich moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlie apperteineth to deuotion, vvhich is as it vvere a refreſhing &amp; devv of heauen; a breathing of the holie Choſt; an exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and yſſue of his grace; a kendling of Faith, Hope &amp; Charitie; and a maruailous brightnes and ſvvetenes, vvhich riſeth of the meditation and conſideration of diuine and godlie things; and ſo transformeth a mans hart, that it maketh him heauie to al euil, and ſvvift to all good things, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him a taſt in thoſe thinges that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to almightie God, and a diſguſt of thoſe things that be of the vvorld, as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> declareth in the beginning of the ninth booke of his Confeſsions, vvhere he
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:9410:153"/>recounteth of him ſelf ſaying, that al vvord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things gaue him diſcontentment, in compariſon of the ſvveetenes vvhich he found in God, and of the beautie of his houſe, vvhich he ſo greatlie loued. This is that vvhich ſpiritual perſons feele euerie daie by experience, vvhoe, at the time that they haue anie greate deuotion, find them ſelues exceeding prompt and redie to al that, vvhich is good, and verie vnvvilling to anie thing that is euil, and ſo in the one they find great contentment, and in the other great diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>So that for this, one of the chiefeſt cares of him that deſireth to goe forvvards, muſt be, that he procure to keepe, and encreaſe this noble affect of deuotion, by al ſuch means as poſſiblie he may: for ſo much more eaſie ſhal the chaungement of his hart be vnto him, hovv much more he ſhal haue it deuoute. And therfore, as thoſe that mind toe vvorke or print anie thing in vvaxe, doe firſt make it ſoft and ſupple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt their hands, and then ſtraite giue it the figure that they liſt: ſo likevviſe he that vvil labour his hart, and print in it the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of verttue, muſt endeuour to make it ſoft vvith the heate of deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo ſhal he doe vvith it, vvhatſoeuer he deſireth. So vve
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:9410:154"/>ſee, that al ſuch as pretend to vvork anie thing, in a matter vvhich is difficult &amp; hard of it ſelf, doe vſe this manner of proceeding. So thoſe that purpoſe to breake anie hard ſtone, doe firſt ſoften it vvith fiar and vina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and then doe ſet vppon it vvith theire yron tooles, and inſtruments to breake it. Thoſe alſo that vvil make right a ſtaffe that is crooked, doe firſt make it ſupple and pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at the flame of the fiar, and then bend it as it pleaſeth them. Moreouer, hovv can a ſmith vvork on ſo hard a mettal as yron is, vvithout the heare of his forge? vvith this heate he doth mollifie the hard yron, and ſo maketh it pliable and obedient, as yf it vvere vvaxe, to the ſtrokes of the ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. In ſo much that the one vvithout the other, vvould not ſuffice for his office, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the hammer vvithout the forge, vvere, as men ſaie, to ſtrike vppon cold yron; and the forge vvithout the hammer, vvere to ſoften the yron, but not to change the forme and figure thereof. And therfore theſe tvvo things be, in theire manner, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to our purpoſe, that is the hammer of mortification, to breake and make right the euil inclinations of nature, and the fiar of deuotion, to make the hart ſofte and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to the blovvs of the hammer.</p>

For ſom fevv excepted, the moſt part doe com to this Sacrament vvithout anie repentance, and vvithout anie exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theire conſciences. Hence it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, that ſoone after their Confeſſion, they returne to their vvicked life, and to the ſame filth in vvhich they vvallovved before. This is a great contempt of God, of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, &amp; of his Sacraments; and it ſeemeth that theſe men com to confeſsion onlie to dallie and mock vvith almightie God, for in confeſsion they deſire him pardon of theire ſinnes, they proteſt an amendment of life, &amp; yet out of hand beginne a freſh

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Contrition</hi> hath tvvoe parts. The one is a repentance for the ſinnes paſt; and the other is a ſtedfaſt purpoſe of amendment in time to com. The reaſon of this is, becauſe <hi>Contrition</hi> is a deteſtation of ſinne, aboue al things that maie be hated, in regard that it offendeth the maieſtie of almightie God. And becauſe God is offended as vvel vvith thoſe ſinnes that ar to com, as vvith thoſe that ar paſt; therfore <hi>Contrition</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the deteſtation of the one and the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:9410:169"/>other; vvhich is as much to ſaie, as that a man muſt be ſory for his ſinnes paſt, and muſt determine to eſchevve ſuch as maie com heere after. And heerehence it is, that the firſt thing in a true penitent, muſt be to haue ſorovve for his ſinnes, not principallie for that by them he hath deſerued hel, and loſt heauen (although to be ſory for this cauſe be good alſo) but for that he hath loſt God, and moſt grieuouſlie offended his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maieſtie. And as God deſerueth to be loued aboue al things, ſo ſhould vve be more grieued for offending him, then for al other things vvhatſoeuer; albeit the mercie of our lord is ſuch, that though the ſorovv be not fullie anſvverable to the ſinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yet the vertue of the Sacrament ioyned therevvith (yf there be no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him that receaueth the ſame) ſhal ſuffice to reſtore him againe to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Novv heere it is to be noted for the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and vveake perſons, that this ſorovv vvhich is required is not ſo of neceſsitie, that it be alvvaies as other ſenſible griefes ar, but that our vvil doe deteſt and abhorre ſinne, aboue al things that maie be deteſted, vvhich maie be vvithout vveeping or ovvtvvard ſorovve.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing requiſite to Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:9410:170"/>vvhich is a moſt ſtedfaſt purpoſe neuer to offend almightie God, muſt likevviſe not principallie be intended for heauen, hel, or anie other particular intereſt of our ovvne, but for the loue of God: albeit to feare hel, or to deſire heauen, ar not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, but ar verie laudable &amp; profitable, yea and a gift of God alſo. And as a man muſt haue a reſolute purpoſe to eſchevv ſinnes that ar to com, ſoe muſt he leaue &amp; forſake his preſent ſinnes, othervviſe his confeſſion ſhould be no confeſsion, but a ſacrilege. And therfore he that beareth anie hatred againſt his neighbour, muſt put it out of his mind, yea and ſpeake to him alſo, yf anie ſcandale ſhould be feared of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. He that vvithholdeth anie mans goods, againſt the vvill of the ovvner, muſt reſtore them vnto him forvvith, in caſe he be able to doe it preſentlie, although by this reſtitution he ſhould caſt him ſelf far behind hand, eſpeciallie vvhen the devv ovvner ſtandeth in ſuch, or like neceſsitie of it him ſelfe. In like manner ought vve to make Reſtitution of fame, and of honour, yf vve haue publiſhed abroade anie grieuous, &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete crime of our neighbour, or donne him anie iniurie by vvoord or deede.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>E novv that deſireth to obteine this moſt pretious ievvel of <hi>Contrition,</hi> muſt knovv that the firſt meane for the getting of it, is to demaund the ſame of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, vvith al humilitie and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie that is poſsible; becauſe the ſame is a ſpecial grace and gift of almightie God and a vvork exceeding al the povver and force of mans nature. The reaſon of this is, for that God created the nature of man vpright, and lifted vp vnto him ſelf by loue, but ſinne hath crooked it, and inclined it doune to her ſelf, that is to the loue of viſible things: &amp; therfore as a man borne vvith a crooked backe from his mothers vvombe, can not find anie natural remedie to reſtore him to his ſtreightnes; ſo vve being borne vvith this kind of ſpiritual crookednes through originall ſinne, there is no thing that can ſtreighten vs, but onlie the ſame
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:9410:171"/>lord that made vs. And becauſe this ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes conſiſteth in the loue of God aboue al things, vvhich no man can haue but by God him ſelf; ſo no man can haue ſorovve for ſinne aboue al things for the loue of him, but by the ſpecial loue of God him ſelfe, for ſomuch as the one folovveth of the other. If this then be a vvorke of God, and ſo greate a vvorke, it folovveth that vve ought to demaund the ſame of him vvith al humilitie and inſtancie poſsible.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meane to obteine Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is for a man to keepe a parliament vvithin him ſelf, &amp; to conſider ſuch things, as maie prouoke and incline him to get ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv for his ſinnes. For the more he ſhal conſider the cauſes that maie moue him thereunto, the more clearelie ſhal he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, hovv much it importeth him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaile his miſerable ſtate. For he that knovveth hovv to conſider his ſinnes, as they ought to be conſidered, knovveth alſo hovv to bevvaile them, as they ought to be bevvailed. Let a ſinner therfore open his eyes, and fixe them firſt vppon the multitude of his ſinnes, and aftervvards vppon almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God againſt vvhome he hath ſinned; for eche of theſe conſiderations vvil teach him, hovv good cauſe he hath to bevvaile
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:9410:171"/>his ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Novv to ſtirre vp thy ſovvle to this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovve, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thou muſt firſt of all ſet before thine eyes all the ſinnes of thie life paſt, &amp; vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al hovv thou haſt abuſed the benefites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of almightie God. And becauſe ſinne is a ſvvaruing from the end, for vvhich man vvas created, let him firſt conſider this end, vvhich vvas to knovve and loue God, and to keepe his commaundements, and therby to atteine to the chiefeſt felicitie: for by this he ſhal ſee more clearelie, hovv far he hath ſtraied from this end. In conſideration vvhereof God gaue him <hi>a Lavve</hi> to vvit his Commaundements, vvherein he ſhould liue; and <hi>Grace</hi> vvhereby he might obſerue his lavve; and <hi>Sacramentes</hi> by vvhich grace be miniſtred vnto him; and <hi>Teachers</hi> that might inſtruct him therein; and <hi>Inſpirations</hi> that might prouoke him thereunto; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie <hi>him ſelf,</hi> to be the price and remedie of al his ſinnes. Likevviſe for this end he gaue him <hi>the gifts of nature,</hi> vvhich be Life, Health, Strength, The povvers of the ſovvle, The ſenſes, and membres of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, to the end that he ſhould applie all theſe in his ſeruice, vvhoe had beſtovved them vppon him. And for this ſame end he gaue him alſo the goods, called the goods
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:9410:172"/>of fortune that vvith them he might ſuſteine his ovvne life, and relieue the neceſsitie of others, and ſo merite the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Theſe and manie others be the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and helpes, vvich God hath giuen vs to emploie them in his ſeruice. Let a man ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider hovv he hath vſed theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifits, and he ſhall find, that he hath made vveapons of them to ſight againſt God; and vvith vvhat things he vvas bound to doe him greater ſeruice, vvith the ſame he hath committed greater ſinnes. He then that ſhall conſider this, hath he not good cauſe to bevvaile and lament his offences?</p>
               <p>The ſecond meane is to conſider vvhat is loſt by ſinne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vvhereof becauſe vve haue ſpoken ſufficientlie in the third treatiſe pag. <hi>236.</hi> it ſhalbe neceſſarie onlie to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe euerie man, that he conſider vvith him ſelf, vvhether he hath not good cauſe to be hartilie ſorie, that hath loſt ſo manie benifits as at there mentioned.</p>
               <p>The third meane is to conſider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the maieſtie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and goodnes of God, againſt vvhome thou haſt ſinned. For it is certaine, that the greater the perſonage is that is offended, the greater is the offence committed againſt him; and ſo the more that a man ſhal vnderſtand the exceeding
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:9410:172"/>greatnes of the maieſtie of almightie God, the more ſhall he penetrate the malice of his ſinne. Conſider then the nobilitie, the riches, the dignitie, the vviſdome, the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the glorie, the goodnes, the maieſtie, the benignitie &amp; povver of this Lord, &amp; hovv al creatures ar bound vnto him; and ſo calling to mind hovv thou haſt offended him, thou ſhalt not onlie vnderſtand the heynouſnes of thy ſinnes, committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but alſo haue good cauſe to be ſory and to lament.</p>
               <p>The fourth meane is to conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie donne to almightie God by ſinne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> For as often as vve ſinne this iudgment paſſeth ſecretelie, in practiſe vvithin our harts, though me perceaue it not; to vvit, of the one ſide is ſet before vs the profit of ſinne, vvhich is the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of God, then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie vvhich is to com by ſinne. Novv vvhat can be more horrible, or more vnſeemelie then this, to preferre ſo baſe a thing before God? or vvhat can more reſemble that vvicked fact of the Ievves, vvhoe vvhen choiſe vvas of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:9410:173"/>vnto them, vvhether they vvould haue Chriſt or Barrabbas, anſvvered, that they vvould rather haue Barrabbas then Chriſt. VVhich things yf a man conſider vvel, he vvil vndoubtedlie be aſhamed of him ſelf, and moued to ſorovve.</p>
               <p>The fift meane is to conſider the great hatred, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that God beareth againſt ſinne, vvhich is ſo great, as no vnderſtanding is able to comprehend it. The reaſon is, for that the better a man is, the more he loueth that vvhich is good, and abhorreth that vvhich is vvicked; and therefore God being infinitelie good, he muſt needes beare infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite loue tovvards goodnes, and infinite hatred tovvards ſinne, and ſo he revvardeth the one vvith euerlaſting glorie, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he puniſheth vvith euerlaſting paines. But becauſe of this hatred againſt ſinne, enough hath ben ſaid in the third treatiſe pag. <hi>237.</hi> procure by the conſideration thereof, to abhorre ſinne ſo much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for thee to doe, and praie God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in the this hatred of ſinne, and ſorovv for the ſame, for therein conſiſteth a greate part of true penance.</p>
               <p>The ſixt meane is to call to remembrance the paines of hell, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and the vniuerſall laſt iudgment, as alſo the particular iudgment
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:9410:173"/>at eche mans death, vvhich things vvil moue vs to conceaue hartie ſorovv and feare for our ſinnes, ſith that eche one of them doth threaten ſuch great terrible calamities to him, that ſhall be found guiltie of anie one deadlie ſinne. And therfore bette it is novv for euerie one, to enter preſentlie into iudgment vvith him ſelf for his ſinnes, that he be not then iudged for them of almightie God; eſpeciallie conſidering that the holie ſcripture aſſureth vs,
<note n="1" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31.</note> that in caſe vve ſhall iudge our ſelues, vve ſhall not be iudged.</p>
               <p>The laſt meane is to conſider the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the benifits of almightie God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and eſpeciallie of thy Creation, Conſeruation, Redemption, Baptiſme, Vocation, Diuine inſpirations, Preſeruation of thee from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and miſeries, vvith other innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benifits. Novv vvhat thing is more to be lamented, then that thou haſt liued ſo long time, in ſuch a greate forgetfulnes and ignorance of ſuch a louing Lord, in vvhome thou diddeſt moue, liue, &amp; hadeſt thy being? vvhat greater iniquitie could be deuiſed, then to offend him vvhoe hath trauailled for thy ſake ſo manie vvaies, faſted ſo manie and ſo long faſtes, ſhedde ſo manie teares, made ſo manie prayiers, ſuffered ſo manie iniuries, taken ſo greate
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:9410:174"/>paines, ſuſteined ſo manie diſhonours, ſo manie in famies, ſo manie, yea and ſo greate torments? For it is moſt certaine that al theſe he ſuffered for thy ſinnes, as vvel to ſatisfie for them, as to make thee vnderſtand the hatred he beareth againſt them, ſith he tooke ſuch paines to deſtroye them.

               <p>The firſt is that he take ſom time before to examin his conſcience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and to cal to mind al his deadlie ſinnes paſt, eſpeciallie yf he haue diſcontinued anie long time from <hi>Confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> in vvhich examination he ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vvith greate diligence and care, as in a

Therfore to auoide this inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a man ought to prepare him ſelf, and to examin his conſcience di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igentlie, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſing the ten Commaundements, and the deadlie ſinnes, vvhich he ought to conſider euerie one, hovv often he hath ſinned in eche of them by thought, vvoord, or deede, vvith al the circumſtances that happened in the ſinne; vvhen the circumſtances be ſuch, as of neceſsitie ought to be confeſſed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond aduiſe is to declare in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion the number of the deadlie ſinnes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And in caſe he doe not remember hovv of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten he hath committed ſuch or ſuch a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſinne diſtinctlie, yet let him giue a gheſſe thereof, as neere as he can poſsiblie, more or leſſe, or els declare vnto his Ghoſtlie father hovv long time he hath continued in the ſame deadlie ſinne; or at the leaſt let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vvhether he hath accuſtomed to offend in that kind of deadlie ſinne as often as
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:9410:175"/>opportunitie vvas offered, or did ſome times vppon remorſe of conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The third is to confeſſe and ſpecifie the Circumſtances, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vvhen they doe greatlie aggrauate the ſinne, although the kind thereof be not thereby chaunged. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the acte of deadlie ſinne is but one thing, yet it maie be accompanied vvith ſom vvickednes of ſuch qualitie, that of neceſsitie it ought to be confeſſed.

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:9410:176"/>ſinne, but a merite and revvard, and ſo it requireth no Confeſsion.

               <p>The ſixte is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that the penitent be careful to preſerue the good name and fame of his neighbour, confeſsing his ovvne ſinnes in ſuch order, that he diſcouer not the ſinnes of others, nor ſpeake of anie perſon by name, but let him onlie ſaie, I haue ſinned vvith a maried vvife, or vvith a ſingle vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp;c.

               <p>The ſeuenth is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that in his confeſſion he excuſe not his ovvne ſinnes, nor yet charge him ſelfe vvith more then is true; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet vtter that vvhich is doubtful for certaine, nor ſuch things as ar certaine for doubtful; but let him declare eche thing in his place as it vvas in deede, vvithout ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or diminiſhing.</p>
               <p>The laſt is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> that he be careful to ſeeke
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:9410:177"/>out a good phiſition for his ſovvle, as he vvould if he vvere ſick for his bodie, for this is a matter of more importance: and to ſeeke out an ignorant ghoſtlie father, is as much to ſaie, as to ſeeke for a certaine guide to bring one to hell: for ſo much as if the blind leade the blind (as Chriſt ſaith) both fall into the diche.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ECAVSE vve ar bound of neceſſitie to confeſſe al deadlie ſinnes, but not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſinnes vnles vve vvil; and for ſo much as this thing, to vvit, vvhich is a deadlie, and vvhich a venial ſinne, can not be vvel declared in fevv vvoords, it ſhal ſuffice to giue ſom general aduertiſment concerning this point, for vvhich there ar vvont to be giuen tvvo Rules.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt generall Rule is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that vvhatſoeuer is contrarie to <hi>Charitie,</hi> that is to the loue of God, and of our neighbour, is a deadlie ſinne. And ſo by this Rule,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:9410:185"/>vvhatſoeuer is againſt the honour of God, or the profit of our neighbour, in anie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importance, be it thought, vvoord, or deede, is a deadlie ſinne; for this quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <hi>Charitie,</hi> vvherein conſiſteth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life of the ſovvle. But vvhatſoeuer is not againſt <hi>Charitie,</hi> but beſides the ſame, is a veniall ſinne; as idle vvoords that hurt no man; or ſom kind of little vaine glorie, of anger, of negligence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Rule is more ſpeciall; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to vvit, that vvhatſoeuer is contrarie to anie one of the Commaundements of almightie God, or of the Catholique Church, is a deadlie ſinne. But heere it is diligentlie to be noted, that that vvhich is of his ovvne nature a deadlie ſinne, maie be a veniall ſinne, by one of theſe tvvo vvaies; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter is of ſmall importance (as yf one ſhould ſteale a pinne, or a point) or becauſe the vvork is imperfect, by reaſon that it vvanted a ful conſent, as it maie hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in euil thoughts, vvithout anie conſent giuen vnto them, but yet euil reſiſted.</p>
               <p>Likevviſe it is to be conſidered, that the Commaundements be of three kinds. Som ar <hi>negatiue</hi> as <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill</hi> &amp;c. VVhich doe bind vs for euer and euer, that is in euerie time, and at all times. Others be <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue,</hi>

There be other <hi>compounded of both,</hi> to vvit of negatiues, and affirmatiues, <hi>as to reſtore other mens goods.</hi> For this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to reſtore, and alſo not to vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our neighbours goods.

For as on the one ſide they knovv, and beleeue certeinlie that they ar not vvithout ſinnes, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, at the time of confeſsion, they find them not, they ar in great perplexitie,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:9410:186"/>and doe fullie perſvvade them ſelues, that they ar neuer rightlie confeſſed.</p>
               <p>Of this vvee may gather tvvo thinges. The one is, that it is in deede a verie hard matter for a man to knovv him ſelfe, and to vnderſtande throughlie all the ſecrete corners of his conſcience, in ſo much that the Prophet ſaid not in vaine,
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>vvhoe is he that knovveth his ſinnes? deliuer me, o Lord, from my ſecrete offences.</hi> Another is, that the ſinnes of iuſt perſons (of vvhome the vviſe man ſaieth,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prouerb.</hi> 24.17.</note> vhat they fall ſeuen times in the daie) ar rather ſinnes of <hi>omitting</hi> then of <hi>committing;</hi> vvhich kinde of ſinnes ar hard to be knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. For vnderſtanding vvhereof, it is to be noted, that all ſinnes ar committed by one of theſe tvvo vvaies, to vvit, either by vvaie of <hi>Committing</hi> (that is by doing ſome vvicked thing, as by robbing, killing &amp;c. or by vvaie of <hi>Omitting</hi> (that is by leauing ſome good thing vndonne, as for not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, not faſting, not praying &amp;c.) Novv of theſe tvvo kind of ſinnes, the firſt (becauſe they conſiſt in doing) ar verie ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and eaſie to be knovven; but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond (vvhich conſiſt not in doing, but in leauing vndonne) ar much harder to be knovven; becauſe that thing, vvhich is not, hath no meane to ſhevv it ſelf. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:9410:187"/>it is not to be maruailed at, that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perſons (eſpeciallie if they be ſimple) doe not find, ſom times, anie ſinnes, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to accuſe them ſelues. For as theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons fall not ſo often into thoſe ſinnes of <hi>Committing,</hi> of vvhich vve haue ſpoken, and the others, vvhich be of <hi>Omitting,</hi> ar not ſo eaſie to be vnderſtoode: hence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth that they knovv not vvherof to confeſſe them ſelues, and therfore ar ſo much vexed.</p>
               <p>VVherfore, for remedie of this, I haue thought good to ordeine this <hi>Memorial,</hi> for ſuch perſons, vvherein is chieflie treated of this kind of ſinnes, vvhich co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerne <hi>Omitting.</hi> And becauſe theſe ſinnes maie be either againſt God, or againſt our ſelues, or againſt our neighbours; therfore is this <hi>Memorial</hi> diuided into three parts, vvhich doe treate of theſe three kinds of negligences. And for this end vve muſt vnderſtand, that there is a difference betvvixt <hi>imperfections,</hi> and <hi>venial ſinnes,</hi> vvherof it enſueth, that ſom things maie be imperfections, vvhich be not ſinnes, as it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth vvhen vve leaue to doe ſom good vvorks, vvhich vve might haue donne, to vvhich vvear not alvvaies bound. For it maie be, that one might beſtovv more almes, then he doeth, and praie more then he praieth, and faſt more then he faſteth,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:9410:187"/>and ſo in other things; and to leaue theſe things is not ſinne, but it is a fault and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, becauſe by doing them, a man might auance him ſelf, and profit much, vvhich he doth not in leauing them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne. Yet let no deuout perſon leaue to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him ſelf for this of ſuch things, as vvel becauſe ſom times they maie be venial ſinnes, as alſo to acknovvledge his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ſo to humble him ſelf before the Vicar of God, and to endeuour to get out of them. Hovvbeit this is not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be donne at al times, but at certeine times, (and eſpeciallie vppon principall feaſtes) to the end they vvearie not theire ghoſtlie fathers vvith theire ſuperfluous length: but at anie other ordinarie times, euerie one maie heere take his choice of that, vvhich he ſhal thinke beſt for the diſcharge of his conſcience.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S amongſt al the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altare is the greateſt, ſo is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite greater puritie and preparation, for receauing of the ſame: becauſe in the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the vertue of God vvorketh, but in this Sacrament is the real, and true preſence of God him ſelf; and therfore, beſides the cleannes of the ſovvle, vvhich muſt goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by meanes of the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, it requireth alſo eſpecial deuotion, to vvhich deuotion three things doe ſerue verie notablie.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe things is, the feare and Reuerence of that diuine maieſtie, vvhich is in this Sacrament, for ſomuch as vve doe trulie beliue, that in that little hoſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:9410:192"/>God, the Creatour of heauen and earth, the lord of the vvorld, the glorie of the Angels, the repoſe of all thoſe that be bleſſed, the iudge of the vvorld, vvhome the Angels, Archangels, Cherubines, and Seraphines doe praiſe, before vvhoſe ſight the povvers of heauen doe tremble, not for that they haue offended him, but for that conſidering the highnes, and greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of that ſoueraine maieſtie, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvledge them ſelues to be but ſo manie vvormes before the ſame. True it is, that this feare cauſeth not in them anie paine, but a moſt high Reuerence; becauſe they knovv, that as there is devv all loue to that infinite goodnes and bountie, ſo to his greatenes there is due all feare. This affection is alſo much increaſed in a man, by conſideration of the greate number of his ſinnes, and dailie negligences. For yf the Angels and Principalities of heauen doe feare him, vvithout hauing donne anie thing vvherefore, ſince theye vvere created, hovv much more ought a vile and vvret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vvorme to feare, vvhich ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and in ſo manie manners offendeth his creator?</p>
            <p>This is then the firſt thing vvhich a man ought to conſider, vvhen he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:9410:192"/>to this table, ſaying vvithin him ſelfe vvith greate Reuerence. I goe novv to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue almightie God, not onlie into mie ſovvle, but alſo into mie bodie.</p>
            <p>But novv this feare muſt be tempered vvith Hope, vvhich the ſame lord of ours giueth vs, by conſidering that he vvith the bovvels of pitie, and compaſsion vppon our vveakenes and miſerie, inuiteth vs to his table, &amp; calleth vs vvith thoſe moſt ſvveete vvords, vvhich are. <hi>Com ye to me, al that labour,</hi>

And in an other place, vvhen the Phariſees murmured of this lord, becauſe he did eate and drinke vvith ſinners, he anſvvered them, that <hi>They that ar vvhole,</hi>

            <p>But touching the hunger &amp; deſire vvhich this heauenlie bread requireth, a greate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue maie be to conſider the effects thereof, and the greate benifits, vvhich by the ſame ar communicated to thoſe, that deuoutlie

               <p>This true Catholique faith, vvithout vvhich no man can be ſaued, vvhich novv I doe vvillinglie profeſſe and hold, I the ſame N. doe promiſe, vovv, and ſvveare to hold and confeſſe moſt conſtantlie, by Gods helpe, intiere and vncorrupted euen to the laſt end of mie life; and to procure, as much as ſhal lie in me, that mie ſubiects, or thoſe of vvhome I ſhal haue care in mie office, ſhal hold, teache, and preache the ſame.
